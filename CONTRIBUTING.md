# Contributing Guidelines

We welcome contributions to our TODO Application project! Please take a moment to review these guidelines to ensure a smooth and collaborative contribution process.

## Feature Discussion

1. **Discuss Features**: Before starting work on a new feature, please initiate a discussion. This discussion should take place in the project's **Issues** section, where you can create an issue to propose the new feature or changes.

2. **Issue Creation**: Every open **Pull Request** (PR) should correspond to a matching **issue**, unless there are special circumstances. **Issues** help in tracking and documenting the purpose and progress of the PR.

## Pull Request Guidelines

3. **Code Owners Approval**: To ensure the quality of the codebase,** at least one code owner** must **approve** a **Pull Request (PR)** before it can be **merged**. Code owners are responsible for maintaining code quality and providing guidance to contributors.

4. **Coding Standards**: Follow the coding standards and best practices established in the project. Ensure that your code is clean, readable, and well-documented.

5. **Testing**: Write appropriate tests for your code changes. Ensure that existing tests pass, and add new tests when necessary to cover new features or changes.

6. **Documentation**: Update the project's documentation if your changes affect the project's functionality or usage.

7. **Commit Messages**: Use descriptive and concise commit messages. Each commit should have a clear and meaningful purpose. Reference the related issue in your commit message if applicable.

8. **Review Feedback**: Be open to feedback and comments on your PR. Address review comments promptly and make necessary adjustments.

## Feature Branches

9. **Feature Branches**: For each feature or bug fix, create a new branch based on the main branch. Use a clear and descriptive name for your feature branch.

10. **Version Tagging**: To track project versions, we create Git tags for significant releases.

## Pull Request Workflow

11. **Fork the Repository**: If you haven't already, fork the project's repository to your own GitHub account.

12. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your changes from the main branch of the project.

13. **Submit a Pull Request**: When your work is complete, submit a Pull Request. Ensure that the PR title and description are clear and related to the corresponding issue.

14. **Review and Approval**: Wait for code owners and maintainers to review your PR. Make revisions as necessary based on their feedback.

15. **Merging**: After receiving an approval from at least one code owner and addressing review feedback, your PR will be merged.

16. **Thank You**: Your contribution is greatly appreciated! Thank you for helping improve the project.

By following these guidelines, we can maintain a high standard of code quality and ensure that everyone's contributions are valued and integrated effectively.

Additionally, create Git tags for versioning and use the Releases tab on GitHub to document significant releases.

If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out to the project maintainers.

Happy contributing!
